<h3> Project List</h3>


<p> <b>Schur Functors of Complexes</b>  This project will be organized
by <a href="http://www.math.wisc.edu/~svs/">Steven Sam</a>.  In 2016, Mark Walker proved the weak
Buchsbaum-Eisenbud-Horrocks Conjecture by incorporating Adams operations
on chain complexes~\cite{walker}. This proof underscored the
significance of allowing functorial operations on chain complexes, and
it led to the development of the Macaulay2 package
ChainComplexOperations by David Eisenbud, which implemented functions
for computing \(\bigwedge^2\) and \(\Sym_2\) of chain complexes.  This
project will significantly expand this line of thinking by allowing one
to apply a  Schur functors \(\bS_{\lambda}\) to a chain complex.  Beyond
the connection with Walker's groundbreaking work, these operations are
fundamental in homological commutative algebra.  This will further
strengthen Macaulay2's already impressive computational tools in
homological commutative aglebra. </p>

<p><b>Computing with FI-modules</b>  This project will be organized by
<a href="https://sites.google.com/wisc.edu/jwg/home">John Wiltshire-Gordon</a>
. FI-modules have become objects of interest in
recent years, with applications to representation stability (see
~\cites{church-ellenberg, cef, cefn,jimenez,wilson} to name a few recent
publications).  This project aims to produce the first algorithms for
computing with FI-modules.  An FI-module may be described by an
FI-matrix over the cateogry \(\text{FI}\).  This project will
implement two basic operations on FI-matrices: finding generators for
kernels, and solving the equation \(AX=B\).  These operations can be used
to compute \(\text{Tor}\) for FI-modules, and also Hilbert series, and those
will be implemented as well. The algorithm over \(\mathbb Q\) relies on
the quiver computation of Sam-Snowden, and the algorithm over \(\mathbb
Z\) relies on the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity result of
Church-Ellenberg~\cite{church-ellenberg}.  This package will allow
researchers to begin experimenting with FI-modules, with the hope of
finding further generalizations of results like Church-Ellenberg's
regularity result. </p>

<p><b>Arithmetic Connections</b>  These projects will be organized by
<a href="http://www.math.wisc.edu/~ellenber/">Jordan Ellenberg</a> 
and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/uwwanlin/">Wanlin Li</a>.  Macaulay2 has not traditionally been
the central computational tool for number theorists, with Magma and SAGE
generally being preferred.  However, certain aspects of modern number
theory and arithmetic geometry involve homological computations about
polynomial rings, which Macaulay2 is particularly strong at.  One unique
aspect of this Macaulay2 meeting will be a series of discussions between
the number theory community at Wisconsin--which is large and
active--with key figures in the Macaulay2 community.  The goal of these
discussions will be to seek out areas that Macaulay2 could expand on its
current strengths and that would be useful to arithmetic geometers. 
Specifically, Ellenberg has proposed developing a package related to
non-abelian Mahler measure, and Li has proposed incorporating algorithms
for computing zeta functions of projective varieties. </p>

<p><b>Random Monomial Ideals</b>  This project will be organized by
<a href="https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~lsilver/">Lily Silverstein</a>, <a href="http://mypages.iit.edu/~dwilburn/">Dane Wilburne</a>,
 and <a href="https://www.math.wisc.edu/~yangjay/">Jay Yang</a>.
  Two separate groups
produced recent work on models for random monomial
ideals~\cite{dpssw,erman-yang}.  A current collaborative effort of these
two groups aims to better understand critical region phenomena between
the dimension jumps in the model of ~\cite{dpssw}.  Early experiments
suggest that, in the limit, the ideals in these critical regions behave
like analogues of fractals, and that we should think of limiting
dimension as being somewhere strictly between two integers.  To better
understand this phenomena, and to open the door for further
experimentation of other groups of researchers, this project will
develop a package around the random monomial ideals of~\cite{dpssw}. 
The basic functionality has already been implemented, so this package
will be primarily interested in producing a framework for experimenting
with these ideals. </p>
