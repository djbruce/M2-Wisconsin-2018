The substantial impact of the Macaulay2 algebra software system on the algebraic geometry and commutative algebra
community has in part been driven the substantial library of user created ``packages''. These packages have greatly 
expanded the immediate THIS THOUGHT SHOULD BE FINISHED.

The broad goal of this workshop is to bring together a diverse group of mathematicians working in and around
algebraic geometry and commutative algebra to spur the development of new and existing packages for 
Macaulay2. 

In doing this we hope to provide an environment for FINISH THOUGHT.

<ul>
<li> Spur the development of new and existing packages for Macaulay2.</li>
</ul>

Towards achieving these goals the workshop will run from Saturday, April 14, 2018 through Wednesday, April 18th, 2018 with 
Friday, April 13th and Thursday, April 19th serving as travel days.
