<ul>
	<li><b>Air Travel:</b> The Dane County Regional Airport (MSN) is located roughly five miles from downtown Madison. Those flying
	into the Dane County airpot should take a taxi to the hotel. (The fare should be roughly $20-$25.)</li>
	
	<br>
	
	<li><b>Ground Trave:</b> It is often cheaper and more convient to fly into O'Hare International Airport (ORD) in Chicago, IL
	or into General Mitchell International Airport (MKE) in Milwaukee, WI and then take a bus to Madison. From O'Hare one can take the
	<a href="https://web.coachusa.com/vangalder/index.asp?nt=0">Van Galder bus</a>, and from Mitchell one can take the 
	<a href="https://www.badgerbus.com">Badger Bus</a>. Both of these have stops at the Memorial Union on UW's campus, blocks
	away from the Lowell Center Hotel. </li>
	
	<br>
	
	<li><b>Campus Travel:</b> Conference activities will all take place in Van Vleck Hall located at the top of Bascom Hall.
	From the hotel it is a short walk to campus. (Those wishing to avoid walking up Bascom Hill can should consider going
	down university and through the Botany Gardens.) A campus map can be found <a href="http://map.wisc.edu">here</a>.
