The substantial impact of the Macaulay2 algebra software system on the algebraic geometry and commutative algebra
community has in part been driven by the library of user created ``packages''. These packages have greatly 
expanded the immediate capabilities of Macaulay2, making it possible for users to do complex computations without having
each user code their own implementation of each program. 

In order to further develop this already impressive library of packages a Macaulay2 workshop will run from Saturday, 
April 14, 2018 through Wednesday, April 18th, 2018 with 
Friday, April 13th and Thursday, April 19th serving as travel days. The broad goals of this workshop
is to bring together a diverse group of mathematicians working in and around
algebraic geometry and commutative algebra to spur the development of new and existing packages for 
Macaulay2. 

Additionally, the workshop will serve as an opprortunity for 

Those interested in participating in this workshop should register by completing the registration form that can be found
by clicking the ''Registration'' button above. We hope to be able to provide most participants with some level
of support for travel and lodging. Once our funding is determined, we will allocate it NEEDEDDE
